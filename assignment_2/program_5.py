# An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate premium.
# - If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male
#   then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
# - If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female
#   then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
# - If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male
#   then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed Rs. 10,000.
# - In all other cases the person is not insured.
# Write a program to output whether the person should be insured or not,
# his/her premium rate and maximum amount for which he/she can be insured.
