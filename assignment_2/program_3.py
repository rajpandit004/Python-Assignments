# Given the length and breadth of a rectangle,
# write a program to find whether the area of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter.
# For example, the area of the rectangle with length = 5 and breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter.

length = float(input("Enter length: "))
breadth = float(input("Enter breadth: "))

# Finding area
area = length * breadth

# Finding perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)

# Checking area is greater than perimeter or not
if area > perimeter:
    print("Area is greater than Perimeter")
else:
    print("Area is not greater than Perimeter")
